# uSPOT

uSPOT [You-Spot] is a new whole experience. It  doesn't only allow you to move around the city and find recommended places near to you, it also gives you the chance of sharing with everyone else your favorite spots.

No matter wherever you are, uSPOT is the perfect app to find those special points you're looking for: nightlife clubs, opened parks, museums, restaurants and more. With a minimalist and an intuitive user interface, you will be able to look for the nearest places to you, check how far are they from your current location and ask for the shortest path to get there. 

uSPOT also gives you information about which of this spots are ready and adapted for people with mobility disabilities, so it will never become a problem for the user.

And this is not all: with uSPOT you can be a part of the community itself. Share your most beloved places with everyone from your mobile phone in the same app. Make those unknown places enjoyable by everyone! 

It doesn't matter if you're a tourist discovering a new place or a neighbour from the city. If you want to discover and share special places uSPOT is the tool you need.

A tool for citizens, made by citizens.

## iCity

iCity is a standardised platform that makes possible to access to city opened information systems in order to create new services. It allows not only to read data, but also to interact with opened information systems. Thanks to its API platform, developers can connect directly with the opened information systems of different cities. 

This app is based on the 3.11 API from the iCity Project. Currently we only support the IRIS Barcelona platform.

Take a look at the iCity API Project here: http://icity-devp.icityproject.com/
